# XAI-LCNN

If you need the training weights, please download them there.: <https://pan.baidu.com/s/1V6Q7Y8nmrjROhBRNGprycA?pwd=NK20>，password：NK20

Due to the limitation of computation, I can only provide the two weights of the standard NN and the standard NN + GradReg.

If you want to re-train, please click there: <https://github.com/kylematoba/lcnn>

You don't need to adjust the super-parameters, follow the authors.

You can draw a local interpreting patch on <https://github.com/NKUShaw/LIME2Net/blob/main/Lime2Net.ipynb>
